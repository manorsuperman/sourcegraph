// * SAML identity provider
// * OpenID Connect identity provider
// * Code host (e.g., GitHub.com, GitLab.com) if it is used to sign into other services
// * Another SSO authentication mechanism, like LDAP

// identity which must be mapped from the authn provider identity. The IdentityToAuthzID interface
// handles this mapping. Examples of authz providers include the following:
//
// * Code host
// * LDAP groups
// * SAML identity provider (via SAML group permissions)
//
// In most cases, the code host is the authz provider, because it is the source of truth for
// repository permissions.

// It is recommended to keep implementations of this interface as simple and cheap as
// possible. Clients of this interface will invoke the AuthzID method as if it is a cheap operation
